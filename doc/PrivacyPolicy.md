# Let’s eSign API Privacy Policy

Last modified: June 27, 2022

## Your privacy is important to us because it is the whole point of our service

We at Let's eSign PBC (“Let's eSign”, “we”, “our” or “us”) respect your privacy and are strongly committed to keeping secure any information we obtain from you or about you, whether you are one of our API Customers or one of their end users (“End Users”). This Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to information we collect from or about you (“Your Information”) when you access Let's eSign's websites (the “Site”), or use Let's eSign's programming interfaces, or associated software, tools, developer services, data or documentation (collectively, the “API”). By visiting the Site or using the API, you agree to be legally bound by and comply with this Privacy Policy, so please do not use the Site or the API unless you have reviewed and understand its terms.

## The information we collect and how we use it

We collect Your Information when you provide it to us when you register with us (if you are an API Customer), when you use the API, or when you access the Site. Our primary purposes for collecting Your Information are to enable us to provide you with API services, to help ensure the quality of our services, to improve products and services of Let's eSign, and ensure compliance with our Terms of Service. More specifically:

### Registration Data (API Customers only)

The only information you give us when you create an account is your root domain. We use your root domain to establish and maintain your account, to deliver to you the services you request, to provide related customer service and to facilitate your use of the API.

### Data Submitted through the API (API Customers & End Users)

Our API takes encrypted data as inputs by the nature of confidential computing (which our API is based on), and we can learn nothing about Your Information from such encrypted data submitted through the API. The data to be encrypted by the API Customers (via, for example, our open-source SDK) before submission include:

- The email address of a signer
- The phone number of a signer
- The real name of a signer
- The content of the document to be signed
- The file name of the document to be signed
- The email address of the sender
- The email message from the sender
- The email address of the notificant

Such encrypted data can only be decrypted and processed by specific [AWS Nitro Enclaves](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/) instances explicitly specified by the API Customers (via, for example, our open-source SDK). The programs such instances run (that is, the behaviors of such instances) can be [remotely attested](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/set-up-attestation.html) by the API Customers or End Users via reproducing, from the source code, the images of such instances. We therefore host related source code in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/letsesign/letsesign-enclave) for such reproducibility.

We will do our best to ensure such publicly-attestable code is invulnerable to attacks that could lead to data leakage and will update the code and the instances regularly to avoid any potential risks.
 
### Tracking, Usage & Cookies Data (API Customers & End Users)

We may automatically collect information about your use of the API and the Site, such as your IP address, user agent and version, the dates and times of access, type of computer or mobile device, and the like. We use the information we collect primarily to inform our efforts to provide an enhanced experience. Please note that we do not set any cookies.

## How we share your information

It is our policy not to sell or rent personal information, and we do not share personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. We do not share the content you submit through the API other than as described below.

We may share Your Information with certain third parties, as follows:

- Acquirers or Assignees: In the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Let's eSign or its assets, we may transfer any and all information that we collect from Site or API users to the acquiring party or assignee.

- Entities Entitled Under Law: We may disclose Your Information as we believe to be appropriate in the following circumstances: (i) when required by applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (ii) to comply with legal process (iii) to respond to requests from public and government authorities; (iv) to enforce the terms and conditions for use of the Site or API, including this Policy; (v) to protect and defend our rights and property; (vi) to protect the interests of Let's eSign or others; and (vii) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. We have no obligation to notify you of such disclosures, except as required by applicable law.

We allow third parties such as Google Analytics to use cookies or other technologies to collect information about Site and API users in order to provide analytics services based on a user’s visits to sites across the Internet and across other mobile applications.

## How we protect your information

Protecting your information is important to us and we take commercially reasonable steps to protect it from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable and any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. In particular, any email you exchange with us may not be secure, and you should, therefore, take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. We will not be responsible or liable for, and will be held harmless from, any damages, losses or causes of action arising out of or in connection with the disclosure of your personally identifiable information.

## How to access and correct your information

You can send us an email to request access to, correct, or delete personally identifiable information that you have provided to us. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law, regulation, legal requirement, or applicable policy or cause the information to be incorrect.

## Other websites

The Site may contain links to websites operated by parties not affiliated with Let's eSign. These linked sites are not under our control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such unaffiliated parties or their websites. If you provide personal information through any such third-party website, the information will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties.

## International transfers of information

By using the Site and/or API, you are deemed to understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of Your Information in the United States, the European Union, and Taiwan, with the awareness that the laws of those jurisdictions may provide different levels of protection for personal information than the laws of the jurisdiction where you are located.

## Modifications and updates to this privacy policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of information about you and will be located at https://github.com/letsesign/letsesign-register/blob/main/doc/PrivacyPolicy.md. If we make any material change to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on the Site. Your continued use of the Site or the API after changes are made to it is deemed to be acceptance of those changes.

## How to contact us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information practices, please contact us via email with PRIVACY POLICY in the subject line. Our intent is to promptly reply to every message we receive. We may also retain inquiries or comments you send to us in order to improve our services in the future.
