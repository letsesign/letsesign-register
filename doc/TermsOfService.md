# Let’s eSign API Terms of Service

Last modified: June 27, 2022

Thank you for using Let’s eSign API, other developer services, and associated software (collectively, "API"). By accessing or using our API, you are agreeing to the terms below. Collectively, we refer to the terms below, any additional terms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies and guidelines as the "Terms." You agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. So please read all the Terms carefully. If you use the API as an interface to, or in conjunction with other Let’s eSign products or services, then the terms for those other products or services also apply.

Under the Terms, "Let’s eSign" means Let’s eSign PBC, with offices at 11F, No 1, Section 4, Nanjing East Road, Taipei, Taiwan. We may refer to "Let’s eSign" as "we", "our", or "us" in the Terms.

## Section 1: Account and Registration

### a. Accepting the Terms
You may not use the API and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Let’s eSign, or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the API under the applicable laws of Taiwan or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the API.

### b. Entity Level Acceptance
If you are using the API on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to that entity).

### c. Registration
In order to access the API, you are required to provide certain information as part of the registration process for the API, or as part of your continued use of the API. Any registration information you give to Let’s eSign will always be accurate and up to date and you'll inform us promptly of any updates.

## Section 2: Using Our API

### a. Your End Users
You will require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, and the Terms.

### b. Compliance with Law, Third Party Rights, and Other Let’s eSign Terms of Service
You will comply with all applicable law, regulation, and third party rights (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws). You will not use the API to encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights. You will not violate any other terms of service with Let’s eSign.

### c. Permitted Access
You will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If Let’s eSign assigns you developer credentials (e.g. registration tokens), you must use them with the applicable API. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client's identity when using the API or developer accounts.

### d. API Limitations
Let’s eSign sets and enforces limits on your use of the API (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API. If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain Let’s eSign's express consent (and Let’s eSign may decline such request or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for that use). To seek such approval, email contact@letsesign.org.

### e. Open Source Software
Some of the software required by or included in our API may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain API, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with Let’s eSign for the applicable open source software.

### f. Communication with Let’s eSign
We may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the API.

### g. Feedback
If you provide feedback or suggestions about our API, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.

### h. Non-Exclusivity
The Terms are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that Let’s eSign may develop products or services that may compete with the API Clients or any other products or services.

## Section 3: Your API Clients

### a. API Clients and Monitoring
The API are designed to help you enhance your websites and applications ("API Client(s)"). YOU AGREE THAT LET’S ESIGN MAY MONITOR USE OF THE API TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE LET’S ESIGN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include Let’s eSign accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect Let’s eSign or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Let’s eSign may use any technical means to overcome such interference. Let’s eSign may suspend access to the API by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.

### b. Security
You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personal data, from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.

### c. Ownership
Let’s eSign does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our API, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our API or the content that is accessed through our API.

### d. User Privacy and API Clients
You will comply with (1) all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personal data and (2) the [Let’s eSign API Privacy Policy](https://github.com/letsesign/letsesign-register/blob/main/doc/PrivacyPolicy.md). You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with Let’s eSign and third parties.

## Section 4: Prohibitions and Confidentiality

### a. API Prohibitions
When using the API, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):

1.	Sublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the API and offer it for use by third parties.
2.	Perform an action with the intent of introducing to Let’s eSign products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.
3.	Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.
4.	Interfere with or disrupt the API or the servers or networks providing the API.
5.	Promote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements.
6.	Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.
7.	Use the API for any activities where the use or failure of the API could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).
8.	Use the API to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.
9.	Remove, obscure, or alter any Let’s eSign terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.

### b. Confidential Matters

1.	Developer credentials (such as registration tokens) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.
2.	Our communications to you and our API may contain Let’s eSign confidential information. Let’s eSign confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without Let’s eSign's prior written consent. Let’s eSign confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose Let’s eSign confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.

## Section 5: Brand Features; Attribution

### a. Brand Features
"Brand Features" is defined as the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of each party. Except where expressly stated, the Terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by you of Let’s eSign's Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to the benefit of Let’s eSign.

### b. Attribution
You agree to display any attribution(s) required by Let’s eSign as described in the documentation for the API.

In using Let’s eSign's Brand Features, you must follow the Let’s eSign Brand Features Use Guidelines.

### b. Your Obligations Post-Termination
Upon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of the Let’s eSign Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored content. Let’s eSign may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.

### c. Surviving Provisions
When the Terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including but not limited to: Sections 4b, 7, 8, and 9.

## Section 8: Liability for our API

## a. WARRANTIES
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS, NEITHER LET’S ESIGN NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE API. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE API, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE API, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE API "AS IS".

SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS.

## b. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, LET’S ESIGN, AND LET’S ESIGN'S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA; FINANCIAL LOSSES; OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF LET’S ESIGN, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE API (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE API AGAIN) DURING THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

IN ALL CASES, LET’S ESIGN, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXPENSE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

## c. Indemnification
Unless prohibited by applicable law, if you are a business, you will defend and indemnify Let’s eSign, and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and users, against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from:
1.	your misuse or your end user's misuse of the API;
2.	your violation or your end user's violation of the Terms; or
3.	any content or data routed into or used with the API by you, those acting on your behalf, or your end users.

## Section 9: General Provisions

### a. Modification
We may modify the Terms or any portion to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our API. You should look at the Terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to the Terms within the documentation of each applicable API, to this website, and/or in the Let’s eSign developers console. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.

### b. General Legal Terms
We each agree to contract in the English language. If we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and Let’s eSign does not take action right away, this does not mean that Let’s eSign is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Let’s eSign relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject. For information about how to contact Let’s eSign, please visit our contact page.

Except as set forth below: (i) the laws of Taiwan will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the API and (ii) ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE API WILL BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN TAIWAN TAIPEI DISTRICT COURT, AND YOU AND LET’S ESIGN CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN THOSE COURTS.
